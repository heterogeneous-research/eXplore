Lens Fork for 'eXplore' project, HackCambridge 2017
========

We used the eLife Lens project in order to make tutorials for personal genetics that are a bit more personal!

For example, rather than reading a static article about how genetics influences taste preferences, we wanted to generate a dynamic article based on the user's own genetic data (e.g. through 23andMe).

What is implemented now:
- Lens fork with example 'taste_prefs.xml' for a specific person's genotype.

What we still want to work on:
- Dynamic xml generation based on user 23andMe data
